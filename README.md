Quiz App
================

###In a team of 4 (pairing) build a webiste to play a quiz game.

A quiz is just a set of questions that can be answered true or false.<p>
1. When a user signs in, she will see quiz questions one by one<p>
2. When the user answers a question, a correct answer is given and a new question is shown<p>
3. A user will need to sign in to play the game<p>
4. The website will save every answer to the database<p>
5. Any registered user will be able to add new questions to the database<p>
6. A user will not be able to answer their own questions<p>
7. The application will show statistics:
- overall number of questions
- the hardest question
- the easiest question
- a table of all users and their scores (percentage of correct answers)<p>
